# Comparison operators in python

a = 10
b = 20
c = 20

# '=' is used to assign value
# "==" is a equal to operator. is used to compare values
# print(a == b)  # a = 10, b = 20, this statement will be False
# print(c == b)  # c = 20, b = 20, this statement will be True

# "!=" is a not equal to operator. is used to compare values
# print(a != b)
# print(c != b)

# "<" is a lesser than operator.
# print(a < b)
# print(c < b)

# ">" is a greater than operator
# print(a > b)
# print(b > c)

# "<=" Less than or equal to operator

# print(a <= b)
# print(c <= b)

# ">=" Greater than or equal to operator
# print(b >= c)
# print(a >= b)

x = 1.1 + 2.2  #3.3
