# Operators and expressions
# operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed

# "=" is used as an assignment operator
a = 10
b = 20

# "+" is used to add to or more values together
print(a + b)

total = b - a
print(total)

# -a changed the value of a (10) to -10
print(-a)

# "*" is used for multiplication
multiple = a * b

print(multiple)

c = 7
d = 3

# "/" is used to represent division
dividend = c / d

print(dividend)

# "//" is used for floor division
floor = c // d
print(floor)

# a = 10, b = 20, c = 7, d = 3

# BODMAS - note: python uses bodmas for calculation
calculation = c * a + b / d
print(calculation)

# "%" is used to get remainder and called the modulo operator

# 7 - 6 = 1
modulo = c % d
modulo1 = a % c

print(modulo)
print(modulo1)

# "**" is used to get the exponent value of a number

square_c = c**2  # c * c
print(square_c)
